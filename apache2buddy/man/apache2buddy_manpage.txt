SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

	A Free and Open Source Project for apache webserver memory usage analysis.

	It is hosted on the domain of the same name.	



OPTIONS

	If no options are specified, the basic tests will be run.

	-h, --help		     Print this help message
	-p, --port=PORT		     Specify an alternate port to check (default: 80)
	    --pid=PID		     Specify a PID to bypass the "Multiple PIDS listening on port 80" error.
	-v, --verbose		     Use verbose output (this is very noisy, only useful for debugging)
	-n, --nocolor		     Use default terminal color, dont try to be all fancy! 
	-H, --noheader		     Do not show header title bar.
	-N, --noinfo		     Do not show informational messages.
	-K, --no-ok	 	     Do not show OK messages.
	-W, --nowarn		     Do not show warning messages.
	-L, --light-term	     Show colours for a light background terminal.
	-r, --report		     Implies -HNWK or --noinfo --nowarn --no-ok --noheader --skip-maxclients --skip-php-fatal --skip-updates
	-P, --no-check-pid	     DON'T Check the Parent Pid File Size (only use if desperate for more info, results may be skewed).
	    --skip-maxclients	     Skip checking in maxclients was hit recently, can be slow, especialy if you have large log files.
            --skip-php-fatal         Skip checking for PHP FATAL errors, can be slow, especialy if you have large log files.
            --skip-updates           Skip checking for package updates, can be slow or problematic, causing the script to hang.
	-O, --skip-os-version-check  Skips past the OS version check.
                                     Allows one to bypass EOL version showstopper but be mindful:
                                      skipping the os version check is not recommended as features may be 
                                      deprecated or removed and apache2buddy is not backward compatible 
                                      with end of life operating systems, this may cause errors and unpredictable 
                                      behaviour.



OUTPUT KEY:

        [ -- ]  = Information
        [ @@ ]  = Advisory
        [ >> ]  = Warning
        [ !! ]  = Critical


EXAMPLES

	curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardforth/apache2buddy/master/apache2buddy.pl | perl
	curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardforth/apache2buddy/master/apache2buddy.pl | perl - --help
	curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardforth/apache2buddy/master/apache2buddy.pl | perl - --report

	Note: The reason for the extra dash after perl and before options, is to tell perl we are sending the options to the script, not perl
	itself, otherwise perl displays its own help or complains about a missing option --report, for example.


ENVIRONMENT

	LC_* variables are checked during preflight checks, they MUST be en_GB or en_US in order to avoid runtime errors.
	Script runs as root and requires apropriate PATH set up to access *sbin* commands.



BUGS

	No known bugs. Bugs or issues can be found here:
        https://github.com/richardforth/apache2buddy/issues


ISSUES

	There is an issue with some parent PIDs consuming large amounts of RAM, child pids inherit this
	but don't necessarily use it, which skews results. The current workaround is to check for PPID
	which is less than 50MB, if over 50MB, the script aborts.
